ðŸŽ‰ This project allows users to take real time notes in a text editor.

## Features

- Unique token for identification, created randomly
- User is able to create a note
- User is able to invite other users into the note
- Notes are differentiated between collaborative mode
- Current mode changeable through users interface
- Notes are synchronized between frontend and database

## Architecture

The project is build using react / javascript in the frontend and flask at the backend.
The database is built using firestore, which is a real-time database.

### How to run this App as localhost
Change routes in the frontend to `http://localhost:3000/desired_route`. 
Run the flask server with `flask run`.

### For any changes
Run `npm run start`inside the client folder, but before save your local changes.
For the deployment you need to run `npm run build`, so the flask server does access the newest build.
